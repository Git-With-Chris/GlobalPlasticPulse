**Objective**

The objective of this data visualization is to create awareness around the amount of inadequately managed waste across all countries of the world, visualize this data and investigate its correlation with the corresponding Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of these countries. The target audience of this visualization are the governments of the world, waste management officials and general public citizens.    

The visualization chosen had the following three main issues:

* Failure to answer a practical question: The visualization infers that GDP is not a good indicator of the amount of plastics being produced this is because GDP is an indicator to the total economic output of a country not the current circumstances of the country. Therefore, it is better to compare based on a country's classification group. On doing so we can infer that countries in lower income group categories generally tend to have higher mismanaged waste.

* Issues with data integrity: A lot of data has been lost as the source document has a unconventional naming system for countries (Eg: Faeroe Islands is misnamed as Faroe Islands), all such observations turn out to become NA values in this visual and it is very hard to identify these NA values (improper representation) in this plot (Sankey Diagram).

* Perceptual Issue: There is a visual overload of information due to high number of observations that need to be addressed. The overlapping circles indicating the GDP cannot be easily perceived by the viewer and as the width of the observations decreases it is hard to compare observations make it hard to generate an actionable insight. The element coding such as text (bolded/unbolded), circle outline (bolded/unbolded) create a bombardment of visual elements to focus on for the viewer.
